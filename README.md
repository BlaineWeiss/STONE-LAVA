## STONE-LAVA is a combined analysis platform for the quantitation of functional imaging data acquired by two-photon microscopy. This document will provide a general overview of their key functions, and their utilization for comparision of cell activity to vascular dynamics.  


# Attention: 
## Uploads in progress!
Optional performance settings and optimizations are in progress. Please be patient as we enable these options.

### STONE-LAVA BETA: (Spatial & Temporal Observation of Network Events) aids in the identification and subcompartmentalization of active cells. Fluorescence time series data extracted from these segmentations are analyzed for signaling events, and transient parameters such as amplitude, rise/decay times, and area under the curve (AUC) are determined. Once all events are indexed, synchronicity of cells within the network is determined by those events and are mapped.

### LAVA: (Localized Analysis of Vascular Astroyctes) is a standalone application with optional pairing with STONE acquired data. LAVA's initial function is to quantify vascular tone changes during imaged experiment trials. It does so by modeling vascular architecture and then measuring cross sectional diameters of vessels of interest. Next, the results can be used to quantify fluorescence changes that occur in perivascular spaces immediately adjacent to the vessel of interest. This allows for directional and correlational assessment of vascular tone changes and vascular/perivascular cell activity. When launched from STONE, cell segmentation data may be used to make additional comparisions with vascular and perivascular activity from the same trial, and field of view.

## Coming Soon!
Additional features and support documeentation.
